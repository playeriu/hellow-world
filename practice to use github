  This is the first time i  add sth to my github,but i don't know what can be added into my repository so i try to write my feeling 
about using the github.
  yes,I'm a newbie to github.
  I am wondering wether i can straightly write down my code in this file as a text file or i should upload my .c file to this 
repository.
  Please forgive me about my strange grammar if there is something wrong with my english, i will correct it XD.
